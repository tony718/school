/*

Write a program that nds the equation of the line determined by two given points. For the
two points you should use 4 variables double x1, y1, x2, y2; Once the user enters these values,
the program continues by determining the equation of the line passing through (x1, y1) and (x2,
y2).
Note, that there are two cases:
1. Slope is undened (vertical line, i.e. x1 == x2)
2. Slope is dened. In the latter case, you will also have to compute the y-intercept. Use double
m, b; for slope and y-intercept respectively.
The code should print the equation of the line.*/
